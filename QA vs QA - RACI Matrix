# QA vs QC Cooperation Across SDLC â€“ RACI Matrix

This table outlines how QA (Quality Assurance) and QC (Quality Control) collaborate in a software development project across each SDLC phase using a RACI model.

## ðŸ”„ RACI Roles Explained

- **R** â€“ Responsible (does the work)  
- **A** â€“ Accountable (owns the decision)  
- **C** â€“ Consulted (provides input)  
- **I** â€“ Informed (kept in the loop)

## âœ… Summary

- QA focuses on **prevention and process governance**
- QC focuses on **execution and defect identification**
- Together, they form a **feedback loop** that improves quality at both the process and product level.
